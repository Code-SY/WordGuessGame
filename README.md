## Title
My web site is called "Word Guess Game". It is simple implementation for well-known game named "Hangman". A player has to enter letter to guess a word which is represented as a set of underscores from the beginning of the game round. If a letter which is not present in the word is entered, a player losses one point out of 8. Once number of points reaches zero, a player losses a game round. Number of wins and losses is displayed in dedicated section. On the right side, a player sees a progress of "hanging" process as number of points goes down. I created a set of simple images and manipulate them with javascrip code. On the top there is Reset button which allows to reset number of wins and losses. I hope you will injoy this game.
